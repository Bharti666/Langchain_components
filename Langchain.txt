What is Langchain?
LangChain is a Python (and JavaScript) framework that helps developers build 
applications using language models (like GPT) more easily and more powerfully.


ğŸ§± LangChain Key Components

1. Models
ğŸ”¹ These are the brains â€” like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, etc.
ğŸ”¹ LangChain helps you connect to them easily.
There are further two types of models- Language models and embedded models. 
Then Language models are also of two types- LLM, and chatmodels.

2. PromptTemplates
ğŸ”¹ These are templates for what you send to the model.
ğŸ”¹ Helps you reuse and structure prompts.

3. Chains
ğŸ”¹ Think of a chain as a pipeline or sequence of steps.

4. Memory
ğŸ”¹ Helps your chatbot remember previous messages.
ğŸ”¹ Useful for real conversations.

5. Agents
ğŸ”¹ These are smart decision-makers.
ğŸ”¹ Agents use tools and decide what to do next based on your input.

6. Tools
ğŸ”¹ Tools are like skills you give the agent:
    Search Google

7. Retrievers & Vector Stores
ğŸ”¹ These are used for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
ğŸ”¹ Example: Search PDFs or docs to answer user queries.

 9. Output Parsers (Outputs)
    Output Parsers in LangChain help convert the raw response from the LLM (usually a long text) into a structured format like:
    a list
    a dictionary (JSON)
